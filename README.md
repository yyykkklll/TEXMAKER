## Abstract

> ***The challenge of fine-grained semantic alignment contin ues to hinder Text-to-Image Person Re-Identification, where clothing-induced interference and a persistent modality gap degrade retrieval accuracy. We introduce a novel framework that decouples identity and clothing features through Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)-guided supervision, enabling robust cross-modal matching.***

## Framework

***Our core approach involves decoupling traditionally coupled features (Figure a) into separate components (Figure b). We utilize the refined text generated by MLLM (identity/clothing) as supervision to force the model to decouple identity and clothing features, achieving robust cross-modal retrieval.***

### **Detailed Architecture**

***The figure below illustrates the detailed workflow of our proposed method, encompassing the BDAM module, the MLLM text generation process, and the multi-task loss employed for forced decoupling.***
